## Description

_**Tipper**_ is a platform where street performers across the globe can set up a custom profile that allows users to find where they are playing at any given time, as well as tip directly through the platform.

Listeners, in the other hand, can follow their favorite artists and get updates of when and where they'll set up to play.
